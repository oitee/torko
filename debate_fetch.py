    answers in that case, which is why this returns three states rather than
    two. Collapsing it to a bool is what caused the misattribution recorded in
    internal_docs/019_WORK_IN_FLIGHT.md: "no evidence" was returned as True,
    every caller read that as "same person", and one arbitrary name was stamped
    onto an entire debate.

    A roster word may appear in the label as an initial ("Salarapatty Kuppusamy
    Kharventhan" / "S.K. KHARVENTHAN"), which counts towards coverage — but
    initials are weak evidence, so at least one whole word must also match
    outright before the two names are treated as the same person.

    letter agreeing is the weakest evidence in this file, and it cannot be
    allowed to carry a name that the label has already positively failed to
    account for. Measured, not theorised — the case that forced this rule:

    bar, and Pawan Kumar Bansal's words were filed under P. Kumar (mpCode
    4546): two different human beings. The coincidence of one common surname
    and one initial outvoted an entire unmatched surname.

    Requiring full coverage instead would also have closed this, and was
    measured: it costs 4.4% of all carried anchors, including obviously correct
    ones ("श्री रवि किशन" / "Ravi Kishan Shukla"). This rule costs
